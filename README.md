# Self-Balancing-and-Position-Control-Robot-Using-Dual-PID-and-PS4-Controller
A self-balancing mobile robot using dual PID control for balance and position. The system applies one PID controller for tilt stabilization and another for position control, with real-time user input provided via a PS4 controller. Designed for embedded control and robotics experimentation.
